### What are the rules of RPS?
Although the game has a lot of complexity, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. 3 simple rules determine the outcome of the game:

- Rock wins against scissors.
- Scissors win against the paper.
- Paper wins against the rock.
